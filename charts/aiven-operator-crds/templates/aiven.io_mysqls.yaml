                    For more information please see [Aiven documentation](https://aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/service-power-cycle).
                    Note that:
                    - When set to `false` the annotation `controllers.aiven.io/instance-is-running` is also set to `false`.
                    - Services cannot be created in a powered off state. The value is ignored during creation.
                    - It is highly recommended to not run dependent resources when the service is powered off.
                      Creating a new resource or updating an existing resource that depends on a powered off service will result in an error.
                      Existing resources will need to be manually recreated after the service is powered on.
                    - Existing secrets will not be updated or removed when the service is powered off.
                    - For Kafka services with backups: Topic configuration, schemas and connectors are all backed up, but not the data in topics. All topic data is lost on power off.
                    - For Kafka services without backups: Topic configurations including all topic data is lost on power off.
